# SQL Query to Retrieve Posts Created by a Specific User

 ● This query `SELECT` specific fields from the posts and users tables, joining them on the author_id and user_id fields `FROM` the posts and users tables, respectively. 
 
 ● The query filters results using a `WHERE` clause based on a specified user_id (replace 'specificUserId' with the actual user ID of interest).
 
 ● A `LEFT JOIN` is utilized to ensure that even when there are no comments by the specific user, the user's data is still displayed
