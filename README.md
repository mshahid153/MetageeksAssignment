Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunities provided. It has been a pleasure to work on the assignments given to me. I have completed each task as instructed, and for your convenience, I have attached separate README files for each task.I thoroughly enjoyed working on these tasks and learned a lot during the process. I hope that the completed assignments meet your expectations. I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with you again and contribute further.

Once again, thank you for considering me for these tasks.

Best regards,
